# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file provides the core configuration for the MariaDB server daemon.
# These settings override the default values to ensure security and proper
# network functionality within our Docker environment.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This section contains settings for the MariaDB server process (mysqld).
[mysqld]

# WHAT FOR: This is a critical security measure. It forces the MariaDB server
#           to run as the unprivileged 'mysql' user instead of 'root'. If the
#           server were ever compromised, the attacker's permissions would be
#           limited, preventing them from taking over the entire container.
user = mysql

# WHAT FOR: This specifies the directory where all database data (tables, logs)
#           is stored. This path corresponds to the mount point of our
#           persistent volume, ensuring data survives container restarts.
datadir = /var/lib/mysql

# Defines the path for the Unix socket file, used for efficient local
# connections from within the container (e.g., by command-line tools).
socket = /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

# Sets the standard TCP network port for MariaDB.
port = 3306

# WHAT FOR: This setting is MANDATORY for inter-container communication. It
#           tells the server to listen for connections on all available
#           network interfaces. The default is often '127.0.0.1' (localhost),
#           which would prevent the WordPress container from being able to
#           connect to the database over the Docker network.
bind-address = 0.0.0.0
