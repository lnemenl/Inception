    # WHAT: Generate a new self-signed SSL certificate and a private key.
    # HOW:  The 'openssl req' command creates a certificate request.
    #         - '-x509':         Outputs a self-signed certificate instead of a request.
    #         - '-nodes':        (No DES) Creates a private key without a password.
    #                            This is CRUCIAL for an automated server setup, as it
    #                            allows Nginx to start without manual input.
    #         - '-days 365':     Sets the certificate's validity period to one year.
    #         - '-newkey rsa:2048': Generates a new 2048-bit RSA private key.
    #         - '-subj "..."':   Provides the certificate's subject information
    #                            non-interactively. The Common Name (CN) must
    #                            match our domain name.
