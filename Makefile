# Inception Project Makefile
# This file is the main entry point for building, running, and managing the project.
# It simplifies the Docker Compose commands into easy-to-use targets.

# Use the project's directory name as the default project name for Docker Compose.
# This ensures all containers, networks, and volumes are grouped under a unique name,
# preventing conflicts with other Docker projects.

# --- Core Targets ---

# The default target that runs when you just type `make`.
# It ensures the environment is set up and then builds and starts all services.
# The -d flag runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).
