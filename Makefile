#
# `PROJECT_NAME` is a 'make' variable that will hold the name of the project.
# `=` is the assignment operator.
# `$(shell ...)` is a 'make' function that executes a command in the system's shell
# and substitutes the output back into the Makefile.
# `PWD` is a default variable that contains the path to the current working directory.
# `basename` is a standard shell command that strips the directory path, leaving only the final component
# (e.g., /home/user/Inception -> Inception).
# `|` is the "pipe" operator in the shell. It sends the output of the command on its left
# as the input to the command on its right.
# `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'` is the 'translate' shell command. It takes the input from the pipe
# and translates all uppercase characters to their lowercase equivalents, as Docker prefers.
#
PROJECT_NAME = $(shell basename $(PWD) | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')

# `all` is the default target that runs when you just type `make`.
# `setup` is a dependency. This means 'make' will run the 'setup' target first.
#
all: setup
# `@` is a 'make' directive. It prevents the command itself from being printed to the terminal,
# so you only see the output of the command.
	@echo "--- Starting Inception services... ---"
#
# `docker-compose` is the command-line tool for managing multi-container Docker applications.
# `-f srcs/docker-compose.yml`: The '-f' (file) flag specifies the path to the Compose configuration file.
# `--project-name $(PROJECT_NAME)`: Explicitly sets a name for this project. Docker Compose uses this
#   name as a prefix for all created resources (containers, networks, volumes) to avoid conflicts.
#   `$(PROJECT_NAME)` is expanded by 'make' to the value we defined at the top.
# `up`: The primary command to create and start containers. It will build images if they don't exist.
# `-d`: The '-d' (detached) flag runs the containers in the background.
#

# This entire block is a single, multi-line shell command.
# `@` at the start applies to the whole block. `\` at the end of a line continues the command.
# `DOMAIN=...;`: This is a shell variable assignment. The semicolon separates commands.
# `$$`: A double dollar sign is required to pass a literal `$` to the shell,
#   as 'make' uses a single `$` for its own variables.
# `$$(grep ...)`: This is "command substitution" in the shell. The shell runs the command
#   inside the parentheses and substitutes its output.
# `grep 'DOMAIN_NAME' srcs/.env`: Searches for the line containing 'DOMAIN_NAME' in the .env file.
# `cut -d= -f2`: The output of `grep` is piped to `cut`. `cut` extracts sections from lines.
#   `-d=` sets the delimiter to '=', and `-f2` selects the second field (the value).
# `PASS=$$(cat ...)`: The `cat` command reads the content of the password file, and command substitution
#   assigns that content to the shell variable `PASS`.

#
# `setup`: A target to run the initial configuration script.
# `if [ ! -f srcs/.env ]; then ... fi`: A standard shell 'if' statement.
# `[` is an alias for the 'test' command.
# `!` is the 'not' operator.
# `-f srcs/.env`: This test checks if a file exists and is a regular file.
# The commands inside the 'if' block will only execute if the .env file does *not* exist.

# `.PHONY`: A special 'make' directive. It declares that the listed targets are "phony,"
#   meaning they are names for commands to be executed, not actual files.
# Why: This prevents conflicts if a file with the same name as a target (e.g., a file named 'build')
#   exists in your directory. It also improves performance slightly.
